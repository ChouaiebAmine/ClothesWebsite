# VERY IMPORTANT NOTE PLEASE READ ME
## the CNN is done (91% accuracy) so you can ignore the notebook but if you want to re-run it read below
download the dataset from here<br>
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist/download?datasetVersionNumber=4 <br>
and place it in the notebook's directory <br>
you only need fashion-mnist_train.csv and fashion-mnist_test.csv<br>
they won't be pushed because i added them to git ignore because their size is big
